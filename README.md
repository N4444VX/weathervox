bash script that gets the weather at KAVL and speaks it via festival TTS engine.

This script is specifically written to announce current weather conditions on an amateur radio repeater.
You will have to specify your locale in the file to make it get the weather for your location.
You will also have to specify your callsign to properly identify your station on air.

Enjoy!
